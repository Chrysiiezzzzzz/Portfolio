                            <dd>Making and Playing video games<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini">My love for videogames runs deep. I've been playing them since I was kid and it's become a genuine passion of mine. My enjoyment of video games has led me to work on creating the games myself, those being: a puzzle-platformer with some rpg elemtes, a fighting game and a jrpg based of off of FFTA and Fire Emblem. I've been working on them since 2020 now and I hope to have something done within the next two years.</span></dd>

I've read over 85 books across my lifetime and enjoyed almost all of them to some degree. Reading has always been a nice way to relax after a long day.</span></dd>
