I later continued to do FLL Robotics in middle school wit an afterschool program I went to called BCNY. I quit FLL in seventh grade and then started doing the older, more mechanical version of FLL called First Robotics Competition, or FRC for short, in eleventh grade. I've been apart of the team since.</span></dd>
