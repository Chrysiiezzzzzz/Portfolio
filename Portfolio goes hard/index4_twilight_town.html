To this day, it is one my, if not my, favorite song yet.</span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqYYThVDdQU&pp=ygUObG9zdCBzb24ga2Fpcmk%3D" target="_blank">Lost Son - Kairi</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> This song is a remix of the song "Kairi" from the Kingdom Hearts series. Lost Son tooks an already lax but slightly somber song, added voice clips from Kingdom Hearts and made it Lo<span class="not-kirbyable">-</span>fi. There is not much else I could ask for. </span></dd>

                            <dd>Future Diary<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> Future Diary is a weird anime of have as one of my favorites. The short-hand premise of it is that the world's god got tired of being god and wanted to chose a new person to be god. He choses twelve people and pits them in a death game. Whoever come out on top becomes god. They are all given different diaries that give them different adventages based upon the person. The main character, named Yukiteru Amano, has the Indiscriminate Diary. It lets him see everything in his surroundings, be it present or future. Only thing is, it doesn't tell him about himself, giving him a blind spot almost all the time. The entire anime is about him and his girlfriend<span class="not-kirbyable">/</span>psycho killer stalker, named Yuno Gasai, trying to win the death game together. Watch it if you like anime that are a little gore<span class="not-kirbyable">-</span>y and don't mind psycho killer girlfriends. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Absolute Duo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> Absolute Duo is about this dude named Tooru Kokonoe, aka Tor. He goes to a special highschool called Koryo Academy, which is for people called Exeeds. Their basically just super soldiers with the ability to manifest weapons known as Blazes. They come in various shapes and sizes like swords, scythes and even guns. But, the rule was that they were always weapons. You can probably tell where this is going. Tor gets a shield, has to fight a student and wins, letting him progress into the school. He gets his Duo, being girl named Julie Sigtuna, because this school runs on an extreme buddy system in which students get paired up and do basically everything together. It's got some funny momnets, some romantic moments but its also got a lot of sad and kinda violent bits too, giving it a nice rounded texture. Watch it if you want. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Clannad<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> This is one of the sweetest and most depressing slice of life animes I've ever watched. I refuse to explain it because you any explaination I could give would not even express 20 percent of how that anime made me feel. Go watch it. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Soul Eater<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> Soul Eater is a very funny anime. It follows three main groups consisting of a Meister, the wielder, and at least one Weapon, the weilde, while they go to DMWA (Death Weapon Meister Academy) and try to collect 99 Kishin souls and 1 witch soul for purposes better explained in the anime. Go watch it. It's hilarious. </span></dd>

                            <dd>Soul Eater Not!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> It's just Soul Eater but gay and slightly more depressing. W anime. </span></dd>
