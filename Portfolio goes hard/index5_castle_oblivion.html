                            <dd>Kingdom Hearts 358 Days/2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="days"> If you could not tell based on the theme of the website, I love Kingdom Hearts. The font I've been using for headers and titles and the footer is from Kingdom Hearts. So, no wonder its one of my favorite game series. However my favorite KH game is 358 Days<span class="slash">/</span>2. It's a DS game that functions on a mission to mission basis and follows Roxas, a boy born without a heart, trying to find out why he exists and what he is doing in this giant base in the World that Never Was. 10<span class="slash">/</span>10 game, would 100 percent recommend. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Dead Cells<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> A grim rougelike about a prisoner who should have died after being beheaded and is now looking for answers. Paired with immaculate sense of comedy, funky weaponary, a banger sound track and an actually cohesive story flow told mostly through boss encounters, its a great game if you want to think sometimes but not all the time. Have throwing sharks. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Pokemon Emerald<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> The premium version of the games in which IGN declared them to have "too much water", It's Pokemon Emerald. It was my basis for Pokemon games and has some of my favorite Pokemon. Plus, the art style and music is reallly good. IGN's review is wrong, this is a 10/10. </span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Kirby and the Amazing Mirror<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> I'm going to 100 percent transparent here and say, I have no reall reason why this is my favorite mainline Kirby titles. It just is. <span class="colon-three">:</span>3</span></dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Hollow Knight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"></span> A suprisingly long game about some bugs, infestation and the mortality of things? that just so happens to be a Souls-like. If you don't mind getting absolutely clapped to have the chance at getting marginally better at a game meant to show how difficult 2d games can be without feeling unffair, you would enjoy this.</dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Terraia<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"></span> This isn't 2D Minecraft. It's got it's own identity and I love it just as much as I love Minecraft. With about 18 bosses spread over 6-ish biomes and 4 seperate difficulties, as well as hardcore mode, you'll be in for the ride of your life. Plus, it's got an amazing modding scene, so that extra points.</dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Yumi 2kki<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"></span> Contrary to popular belief, I do like some horror games. Yume Nikki's sequal, Yume 2kki, spelt as Yume Nikki since ni is 2 in Japanese, is technically a horror game, sometimes. But, sometimes it isn't and I like that. Sometimes I want to cry in a corner out of fear and sometimes, I want to chill with my homies in the Famicom worlds, it all depends on where I go.</dd>
                                <br>
                            <dd>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"></span> This game needs many an introduction, seeing how its a lot less popular than I though. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, or FFTA for short, is a jrpg about a group of kids who get picked on for various really stupid middle school reasons that end up geting stuck in their favorite game; Final Fantasy. It plays like an isometric Fire Emblem with one of, if not, the best class system I've ever seen. You have to play it.</dd>
