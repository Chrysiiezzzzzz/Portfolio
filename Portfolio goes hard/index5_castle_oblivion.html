                            <dd>Kingdom Hearts 358 Days/2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="days"> If you could not tell based on the theme of the website, I love Kingdom Hearts. The font I've been using for headers and titles and the footer is from Kingdom Hearts. So, no wonder its one of my favorite game series. However my favorite KH game is 358 Days<span class="slash">/</span>2. It's a DS game that functions on a mission to mission basis and follows Roxas, a boy born without a heart, trying to find out why he exists and what he is doing in this giant base in the World that Never Was. 10<span class="slash">/</span>10 game, would 100 percent recommend. </span></dd>

                            <dd>Dead Cells<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> A grim rougelike about a prisoner who should have died after being beheaded and is now looking for answers. Paired with immaculate sense of comedy, funky weaponary, a banger sound track and an actually cohesive story flow told mostly through boss encounters, its a great game if you want to think sometimes but not all the time. Have throwing sharks. </span></dd>

                            <dd>Pokemon Emerald<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> The premium version of the games in which IGN declared them to have "too much water", It's Pokemon Emerald. It was my basis for Pokemon games and has some of my favorite Pokemon. Plus, the art style and music is reallly good. IGN's review is wrong, this is a 10/10. </span></dd>

                            <dd>Kirby and the Amazing Mirror<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mini"> I'm going to 100 percent transparent here and say, I have no reall reason why this is my favorite mainline Kirby titles. It just is. <span class="colon-three">:</span>3</span></dd>
